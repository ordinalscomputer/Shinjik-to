# Shinjik-to
The Ordinals Computer Company (OCC) is proud to present Shinjikēto aka Syndicate, an AI x Human generated digital artifacts project that combines pixelated anime style with cutting-edge technology on Bitcoin. This project consists of 98 characters and 2 commemorative pieces inscribed using Ordinals on the secure and reliable Bitcoin blockchain, each with its own story, personality, and significance. The digital artifacts will be sold for 0.005 BTC per artifact.

In addition to the 98 characters, the Ordinals team has created 2 special pieces, a work of art in the style of a Super Nintendo cover that serves as an introduction to the Shinjikēto project. This piece will be the first piece minted and be referenced as "00". It will be auctioned off, giving one lucky collector the chance to own a piece of Shinjikēto history that will stand the test of time. The 2nd special piece is referenced "99" a collage commemorating the entire Shinjikēto collection that will also be auctioned off.

Shinjikēto is about creating a community of individuals who are passionate about digital artifacts, nfts, art, ordinals, blockchains and Bitcoin. It's about bringing people together who appreciate the beauty and significance of these things, and sharing that appreciation with others.

So why not join the Shinjikēto revolution today and be part of something truly unique and exciting? Get ready to experience the art and culture of anime like never before, as you immerse yourself in the world of Shinjikēto.
